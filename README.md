# Movie-dataset-python-project-
In this assignment, we are trying to find some interesting insights into a few movies released between 1916 and 2016 using Python. We will write Python code to explore the data, gain insights into the movies, actors, directors, and collections, and submit the code.

# Some steps to follow in this project
<ul>
  <li>
    Identify the task to be performed correctly, and only then proceed to write the required code.
  </li>
  <li>
    Always keep inspecting your data frame after you have performed a particular set of operations.
  </li>
  <li>
    Be careful about rows or columns with missing values. Deciding how to handle them (e.g., dropping, imputing, or using advanced methods) can significantly affect your analysis.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ensure the data doesnâ€™t contain duplicate entries, especially in cases where each entry should be unique.
  </li>
  <li>
    If data types are misrepresented (e.g., strings instead of numbers, dates stored as text), they can cause issues in analysis. Always validate and convert types where needed.
  </li>
</ul>
